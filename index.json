These personas would be used as tools to help align business requirements with customer wants and needs.\nA persona is a fictional character that represents a customer or target audience. A persona has a name, a picture, some demographic information, and other meaningful characteristics. Personas are based on user research—in this case, the Isilon personas are based on customer interviews, site visits, and surveys—and are composites of real people from the group the persona represents.\nThe Isilon user personas that we created represent new and veteran System Administrators working in the health sciences, media and entertainment, and private sector verticals. Each persona includes a quote from a real user, a short bio, a list of goals and motivations, daily tasks, and pain points. These personas are used by engineering, documentation, and training teams for planning and developing user-centered product requirements.\n\n"

Heuristic evaluations are one of the most popular inspection-based methods for identifying usability problems in the user interface. An evaluator systematically examines the interface and compares it against a checklist of usability principles.\nThis heuristic checklist is used by developers, UX researchers, and writers. It provides a quick and inexpensive way to obtain early feedback in the design process while suggesting corrective measures.\n\n"

	"content": " Helping Customers Help Themselves Download the Isilon Supportability and Compatability Guide (PDF).\n Overview I was lucky to be asked to create Isilon’s first customer-facing compatibility guide. You might not believe me, but there was no single, authoritative source for compatibility information before.\nWhen customers wanted to upgrade OneFS or buy new Isilon hardware, they had to call Isilon Support or their account manager with compatibility-related questions. This put an unreasonable burden on customers looking for information, who just wanted to look up an answer and get back to work. Knowing that customers are savvy, like self-support, and demand convenience, I made the compatibility guide public.\nThe compatibility guide is a reference guide and includes such topics as Isilon software upgrades, Isilon hardware interoperability, protocols, web browsers, drive and node firmware, and cables, among other things. All the information was collected from interviews with subject matter experts (SMEs) and was vetted by engineers, QA, and key management stakeholders. The guide is refreshed when new Isilon products come to market.\nSince its initial release, the Isilon Supportability and Compatibility Guide is Isilon’s #1 accessed document, with thousands of weekly downloads by both external and internal customers. This document is a must-have for anyone upgrading Isilon software or hardware.\n"
